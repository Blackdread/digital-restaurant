### Microservices / Websockets / AxonServer

*This is a thin layer which coordinates the application activity. It does not contain business logic. It does not hold the state of the business objects*

We designed and structured our [loosely coupled components](https://github.com/idugalic/digital-restaurant/tree/master/drestaurant-libs) in a modular way, 
and that enable us to choose different deployment strategy and take first step towards Microservices architectural style.

Each [microservice](https://github.com/idugalic/digital-restaurant/tree/master/drestaurant-apps/drestaurant-microservices-rest):

 - has its own bounded context,
 - has shared event(sourcing) storage (AxonServer)
 - and we route and distribute messages (`events`, `commands`, `queries`) between them via AxonServer
  
#### AxonServer & event messages & command messages & query messages

The key characteristics of [AxonServer](https://axoniq.io/product-overview/axon-server) are:
 
 - Dedicated infrastructure for exchanging three types of messages (`commands`, `events`, `queries`) in a message-driven micro-services environment
 - Purpose-built database system optimized for the storage of event data of the type that is generated by applications that use the event sourcing architecture pattern
 - Built-in knowledge on CQRS message patterns
 - Easy-to-use and easy-to-manage
 
Both [AxonFramework](https://axoniq.io/product-overview/axon-framework) and [AxonServer](https://axoniq.io/product-overview/axon-server) form an [Axon platform](https://docs.axoniq.io/reference-guide/).


Axon platform is end-to-end development and infrastructure platform for smoothly evolving Event-Driven microservices focused on CQRS and Event Sourcing.

AxonFramework and AxonServer are `open source`. [Axon Server Enterprise](https://axoniq.io/product-overview/axon-enterprise) is targeted towards mission-critical, medium to large scale production deployments of Axon. AxonEnterprise is not open source.

Axon is integrated with Spring Boot platform. You can choose many Spring Boot starters, and start with minimal configuration.
AxonServer is configured by default.

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.axonframework</groupId>
    <artifactId>axon-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <version>${axon.version}</version>
</dependency>

```

### STOMP over WebSockets API


#### Customer (command side)

WebSocket SockJS endpoint: `ws://localhost:8081/customer/websocket`


 - `/app/customers/createcommand`, messageType=[MESSAGE]
 
#### Courier (command side) 

WebSocket SockJS endpoint: `ws://localhost:8082/courier/websocket`


 - `/app/couriers/createcommand`, messageType=[MESSAGE]
 - `/app/couriers/orders/assigncommand`, messageType=[MESSAGE]
 - `/app/couriers/orders/markdeliveredcommand`, messageType=[MESSAGE]
 
#### Restaurant (command side)

WebSocket SockJS endpoint: `ws://localhost:8084/restaurant/websocket`


 - `/app/restaurants/createcommand`, messageType=[MESSAGE]
 - `/app/restaurants/orders/markpreparedcommand`, messageType=[MESSAGE]
 
#### Order (command side)

WebSocket SockJS endpoint: `ws://localhost:8083/order/websocket`

 - `/app/orders/createcommand`, messageType=[MESSAGE]

#### Query side

WebSocket SockJS endpoint: `ws://localhost:8085/query/websocket`


 - `/app/customers`, messageType=[SUBSCRIBE]
 - `/app/customers/{id}`, messageType=[SUBSCRIBE]
 - `/app/couriers`, messageType=[SUBSCRIBE]
 - `/app/couriers/{id}`, messageType=[SUBSCRIBE]
 - `/app/couriers/orders`, messageType=[SUBSCRIBE]
 - `/app/couriers/orders/{id}`, messageType=[SUBSCRIBE]
 - `/app/restaurants`, messageType=[SUBSCRIBE]
 - `/app/restaurants/{id}`, messageType=[SUBSCRIBE]
 - `/app/orders`, messageType=[SUBSCRIBE]
 - `/app/orders/{id}`, messageType=[SUBSCRIBE]
 - `/app/restaurants/orders`, messageType=[SUBSCRIBE]
 - `/app/restaurants/orders/{id}`, messageType=[SUBSCRIBE]
 - `/topic/couriers.updates` (courier list has been updated, e.g. new courier has been created)
 - `/topic/customers.updates` (customer list has been updated, e.g. new customer has been created)
 - `/topic/orders.updates` (order list has been updated, e.g. new order has been created)
 - `/topic/restaurants.updates` (restaurant list has been updated, e.g. new restaurant has been created)
 - `/topic/couriers/orders.updates` (courier order list has been updated, e.g. new courier order has been created)
 - `/topic/restaurants/orders.updates`(restaurant order list has been updated, e.g. new restaurant order has been created)



## Development

This project is driven using [Maven][mvn].

### Clone

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/idugalic/digital-restaurant
```

### Build

```bash
$ cd digital-restaurant
$ mvn clean install
```


### Run microservices

[AxonServer](https://axoniq.io/product-overview/axon-server) is required.

```bash
$ cd digital-restaurant/drestaurant-apps/drestaurant-microservices-websockets/drestaurant-microservices-websockets-comand-courier
$ mvn spring-boot:run
$ cd digital-restaurant/drestaurant-apps/drestaurant-microservices-websockets/drestaurant-microservices-websockets-comand-customer
$ mvn spring-boot:run
$ cd digital-restaurant/drestaurant-apps/drestaurant-microservices-websockets/drestaurant-microservices-websockets-comand-restaurant
$ mvn spring-boot:run
$ cd digital-restaurant/drestaurant-apps/drestaurant-microservices-websockets/drestaurant-microservices-websockets-comand-order
$ mvn spring-boot:run
$ cd digital-restaurant/drestaurant-apps/drestaurant-microservices-websockets/drestaurant-microservices-websockets-query
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```


## Continuous delivery

We have one deployment pipeline for all applications and libraries within this repository. In addition, all projects in the repository share the same dependencies. Hence, there are no version conflicts because everyone has to use the same/the latest (SNAPSHOTS) version. And you don't need to deal with a private NPM (JavaScript) or Maven (Java) registry when you just want to use your own libraries.
This setup and project structure is usually addressed as a [monorepo](https://medium.com/@maoberlehner/monorepos-in-the-wild-33c6eb246cb9).
